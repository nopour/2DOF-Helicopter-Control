# 2DOF-Helicopter-Control
  The Quanser 2 DOF Helicopter experiment, shown in Figure 1.1, consists of a helicopter model mounted on a fixed base with two propellers that are driven by DC motors. The front propeller controls the elevation of the helicopter nose about the pitch axis and the back propeller controls the side to side motions of the helicopter about the yaw axis. The pitch and yaw angles are measured using high-resolution encoders. The pitch encoder and motor signals are transmitted via a slipring. This eliminates the possibility of wires tangling on the yaw axis and allows the yaw angle to rotate freely about 360 degrees.
